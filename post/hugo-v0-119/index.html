    <title>5 Science-Backed Longevity Tips</title>

<meta name="description" content="Longevity isn&rsquo;t just about genetics—up to 80% of lifespan variance is influenced by lifestyle choices.
Here are five research-backed habits that can help you live longer and healthier:
1. Strength Training &amp; Daily Movement Strength training twice a week can reduce all-cause mortality by 10–20% (JAMA Network Open, 2022). Walking 7,000–10,000 steps per day lowers premature death risk by 50% (JAMA, 2021). 2. Follow a Mediterranean Diet A Mediterranean diet (rich in olive oil, fish, nuts, and whole foods) lowers heart disease risk by 30% (NEJM, 2013). High polyphenol intake reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, slowing aging processes. 3. Prioritize Sleep &amp; Circadian Health 7–9 hours of quality sleep reduces chronic disease risk and promotes longevity (Harvard Medical School). Aligning sleep with natural light cycles improves metabolism and cardiovascular health. 4. Practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) or Caloric Restriction IF and caloric restriction promote cellular repair, mitochondrial function, and longevity (Cell Metabolism, 2018). The 16:8 fasting method (fasting for 16 hours, eating in an 8-hour window) can improve metabolic health. 5. Maintain Strong Social Connections Studies show loneliness is as deadly as smoking 15 cigarettes per day (PLOS Medicine, 2010). People with strong social connections live up to 10 years longer (Blue Zones Research). Key Takeaway By making simple, research-backed adjustments—moving more, eating whole foods, optimizing sleep, fasting, and fostering relationships—you can increase both lifespan and healthspan significantly.
